## Guns

Hi, In this file we will be looking at multiple guns scripts.

* The first Gun.cs Script contains the main Gun animation code so this script connects all of the other scripts and does firing, reload, and more animations.
```cs script

```
* The Sway.cs script adds this moving effect to the gun so whenever you move the camera the gun won't stay static.
```cs script

```
* The Aim.cs script is just a simple script that updates the Gun Object position when clicked the right mouse button.
```cs script

```
