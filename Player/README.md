## Player Controllers

Hi, In this folder we will be lloking at multiple Player Scripts.

In this case we have the Third Person Controller Ones:
* ThirdPlayerControllerWeapon.cs Contains a Character animations script to enable and trigger all of the animator stuff for a character with a sword or anything like that, it also does the movement, this took lot of work connecting animator so enjoy.

First Person Controller Scripts:
* FirstPersonCamera.cs is just a script that needs to be dragged to the camera to follow the mouse movement.
* FirstPersonController.cs is just basic first person movement connecting with the Guns scripts.

There's pretty much no code recommendations here, just read all the code and see if there's something for you, gl!
