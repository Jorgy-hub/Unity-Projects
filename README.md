## Unity Projects

Welcome to my Unity Multiple Assets repository, I will be using this repo to drop some of the code I use for creating my 3D Games.
In case you want to learn a bit more or need a small help with your games I'm leaving this open source so you can test.

## 📚 Contents:

* Player: This folder contains assets for several player movement or camera scripts.
* Guns: This folder contains script for coding a gun, with movements like sway or aim.
* Enemies: Enemy attacking and following AIs with animations.
* Spring Bone: Model Physics connections scripts.
