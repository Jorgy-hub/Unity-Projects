## Spring Bones.

In this folder we have the spring bones which are used to give animations to moving parts of a model, like hair, clothes, etc.
* SpringBone.cs is the basic script added to each bone model part for it to connect and move.
* SpringBoneManager.cs like the name says is the manager and all the SpringBones need to be configured there.
* SpringBoneCollider.cs is just a script to prevent collision with other stuff.

Don't edit anything of this files, they work just perfectly, just modify your values in the editor.
